*NOTE:* At the beginning when I setup my personal radio, I was using MP3 files and decode them as MP3 again since almost all of the browsers and platform support it. the problem with this is that mp3 is a proprietary codec and you need to have their libraries to be able to encode your mp3 files so I added a step to include it on the instructions. this might be a problem for us in the future but we can use other codecs to get around it in the next version of our online radio.
